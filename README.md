Getting Started
To get started with this repository, you will need to have Node.js installed on your system. If you're not sure whether you have Node.js installed, just ask your computer: "Node.js, are you there?" If it responds with "yes, my child", you're good to go. If not, go ahead and install Node.js.

Once you have Node.js installed, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/learning-graphql.git
Next, navigate to the root of the project and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

Copy code
npm install
GraphQL Basics
The schema.js file contains the schema for your GraphQL API, which defines the types of data that can be queried or mutated. Think of it as the blueprint for your API - you wouldn't build a house without a blueprint, would you?

The resolver.js file contains the resolver functions that handle the actual data fetching and manipulation. It's like the brain of your API - without it, your API would be as useful as a zombie with no brains.

Querying Data with GraphQL
The clientQueries.js file contains the queries that can be executed on your GraphQL API. These queries can be tested in the GraphQL Playground, which is like a playground for adults - you get to have fun and learn at the same time!

Mutating Data with GraphQL
The schema.js file also defines the mutations that can be executed on your GraphQL API. These mutations can be tested in the GraphQL Playground as well. So go ahead and mutate some data - just make sure to ask for its consent first.

Contributing
Contributions to this repository are always welcome! If you find a bug or would like to contribute new code or resources, please submit a pull request. Just remember to be kind and respectful - we're all in this together.
